<h2  id="the_father">The Father</h2>
<figcaption>
<p>Kratop, despite trying to leave his bloody past as the Ghost of Sparta behind, is still haunted by the man - the god - he was.  His relationship with Atreus has been distant, stem, and disciplined.  Now coping with the
death of his wife, Kratos must learn to be the father that his son needs so they can both survive their journey across distant realms to lay Fays to rest.</p></figcaption>

<h2 id="the_son">The Son</h2>
<figcaption>
<p>Atreus is a young boy dealing with the sudden loss of this mother and a cold, distant father.  Despite being sickly as a child and only very recently recovering enough to travel, Atreus wants nothing more than to
fulfill his mother"s final wish and prove to his father that he is strong.  Having been taught by Fays how to use a bow and hunt, Atreus hopes that he can show Kratos he will be an asset 0n the9r journey and that he is no
longer the frail boy he used to be.</p></figcaption>

<h2 id="arrival_of_the_stranger"> Arrival of the Stranger</h2>
<figcaption>
<p>After the funeral of Faye, Kratos and Atreus are visited by a mysterious stranger - one who seems intent on picking a fight with the legendary God of War from a distant land.  Baldur says he is sent by Odin to
investigate the home and its residents, indicating that perhaps he, and the rest of the Norse Gods, are much more aware of Kratos' past than even his own son.<br>

They clash, tearing throught the earth and rock surrounding the home in a bloody brawl that reveals Baldur has lost the ability to feel anything - impervious to pain and pleasure alike.  Though the battle is close Kratos
is able to harness his rage and finally beats Baldur into submission.  While he has rid them of the immediate threat, Kratos realizes that his home, and his son, are no longer safe.  They must make the journey now -
whether Atreus is ready for it or not.</p></figcaption>
<h2 id="sons_of_thor">Sons of Thor</h2>

<p>Along their journey, the trio are ambushed by the two men they saw accompanying Baldur, Magni and Modi.  They battle Kratos and Atreus fiercely, though Kratos is able  to strike a kiling blow on Magni.<br>

Modi flees, but later finds the pair again.  By killing Kratos, he hopes to regain his honor and prove that he is worthy of  Thor's legacy.  Modi subdues Kratos, but seeing his father in peril, Atreus instinctively triggers
what appears to be his own Spartan Rage ability.</p>
<p>Not knowing his own godhood, Atreus is overrwhelmed by the sudden surge and fells unconscious, his childhood illness seemingly returned and worse than ever.  Kratos fends off Modi, who quickly  departs
knowing his life is in danger.  Seeing that Atreus is barely alive, Kratos takes his son to Freye in the hopes herr magic can help save his son.</p></figcaption>

<p> They fight again, but throught their shared strength, Kratos and Atreus are finally able to beat the newly vulnerable Baldur, who demands they kill him and end his wife while he is still able to feel.  Freya pleads with them to 
spare her only son, and Kratos relents - knowing all too well the pain a parent feels at losing a child.</p>
<p>As they turn to leave, Baldur uses his remaining strenght to try and strangle Freya as payment for his years of numb torment.  Freya accepts her death, hoping it will give her son some semblance of peace in his life
to know she's gone.</p>
<p> Kratos, seeing his own bloody mistakes about to be repeated by Baldur, steps in to save Freya's life by killing her son.  Unable to accept his death, Freya cradles the dead body of Baldur while swearing vengeance
upon Kratos for taking away her only child, even if it meant that she would live.</p></figcaption>

come to pass, as well as what had come before.</p>
<p>They discover that this was all left for them by Faye, who was a Giant hersalf - a secret she had kept from her husband and son.  Atreus finallu uncovers the full truth of his heritage, that he is not only part god and
part mortal, he is part Ginat as well.</p>
